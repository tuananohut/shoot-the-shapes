## How To Play?

You don't need the source code to play the game. Just download the Shoot The Shapes/Debug files and run the .exe file. That should be sufficient to play the game. If you try to open the game using the source code, you may encounter issues, though I'm not sure as I haven't tried it. If you are using Windows Defender, you may experience difficulties downloading and opening the game.

Move: W A S D

Spawn Bullet: Left Button

Spawn Special Bullet: Right Button

### Possible errors you may encounter while playing:

- If you force the main character, the red octagon, it can go outside the screen.

### General Info About The Game

- You need to wait for a few seconds to use the Special Bullet.

- If you continuously collide with enemies, your health will decrease, and the player will die, causing the game to automatically close.

- The enemy spawn rate increases as your score goes up, and then it stabilizes.
